Data Analyst. 

For ten years, Iâ€™ve been building a successful career in translation and administrative management, where I was particularly drawn to analytical work and teamwork. I took advantage of a career break due to my relocation to Israel to acquire skills as a data analyst. I am eager to develop in this field and present the results of my work in a clear and concise manner, as described by C. Nussbaumer Knaflic in her book Storytelling with Data. Currently looking for a remote position.

- MS Excel, Power Point
- SAP
- Correlation analysis, statistical hypothesis testing,  data visualization
